<<h1>Worst website in the World</h1>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<h3>What website did we find?</h3>

<p>
  We found this website for a... [Spa and healthcare center](http://www.serene-naturist.com/Naturist.html). **Not only** is it terrible, we're still not sure what it does.
</p>

<h3>How did we find it?</h3>

<p>
  Looking for blogs that mock bad website design, we found one that looked rather terrible itself.
  <<b>This</b> website however was far worse! One of us is still bleaching his eyes every hour.
</p>

### Does it have regular updates?
Define regular? In short, no. It looks like it was made in MS Paint, by someone actively having an epileptic seizure.

### What did this website teach us?

- [ ] Where to go for a good massage
- [x] How bad a migraine can get

### Ways and places this hurts

Place | Type of pain
------------ | -------------
Head| Physical
Heart| Emotional

### What has to be removed?

* Music, especially the automatic download feature
* Links that aren't actual links
* Stock photo's and Flash elements
* Wrong use of emphasis

### What would we change about it?

1. Make a more soothing contrast
2. Scrolling navigation bar
3. Remove Flash elements
4. Social media
5. Exchange stock photo's of actual informative photo's.

For example, rather than this:

Have an actual photo of the spa, or the owners, adjusted to the page layout.

### Why does it need an overhaul?
 - To provide information on their services
 - To feel and look professional
